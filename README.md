FYCalculatorTutorial2
=====================

Second, slightly more complicated, calculator app I am making for learning purposes. 


There are two issues I need to resolve.
1) I have created two objects in FYNumber.h called displayNumber and hiddenNumber. Unlike other objects I have created in the past, I can't seem to get access to them anywhere in the FYNumber class or classes that #import the FYNumber class. I'm sure I am missing something obvious, but I can't figure it out and it is driving me crazy.
2) I have a basic idea of the organization of the app, but need some help to make sure it is OK. Also, there are a lot of little issues like issue #1 that I could use help with solving.

I'm more comforatable with Python and have read up on objective-c, but have realized I need to start working on some basic projects to get some real experience. I'm a bit new to OOP though and have a lot to learn.

Thanks!
